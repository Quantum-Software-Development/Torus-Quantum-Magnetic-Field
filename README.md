## Torus [Mathematically Speaking:](https://github.com/Quantum-Software-Development/README/blob/de863aea73ea56558093652acb707ef038f17217/torus_pgfplots_package.tex)
### The torus is a doughnut-shaped surface in three-dimensional space, described by the following parametric equations:

<br>

### 🌀 Parametric [Equations of a Torus]():

<br>

$$\color{DodgerBlue} \large \begin{align*}
x(\theta, \phi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \cos \phi \\
y(\theta, \phi) &= (R + r \cos \theta) \sin \phi \\
z(\theta, \phi) &= r \sin \theta
\end{align*}$$

```latex
\begin{cases}
x(u,v) = (R + r \cos v) \cos u \\
y(u,v) = (R + r \cos v) \sin u \\
z(u,v) = r \sin v \\
\text{where } u \in [0, 2\pi],\ v \in [0, 2\pi]
\end{cases}
```

<br>


### [**Variables:**]():

- $R$: major radius — the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube  
- $r$: minor radius — the radius of the tube itself  
- $u$: angle around the main axis (longitudinal rotation)  
- $v$: angle around the tube (cross-sectional rotation)

<br>  

### ***These equations describe a 3D surface by sweeping a circle of radius $$r$$ around an axis located at a distance $$R$$ from the circle's center***.

You can visualize the torus as a **donut-shaped surface** where:  
- The whole shape rotates around the z-axis via $$u$$  
- The circular cross-section rotates via $$v$$

<br>

***Use these equations in 3D rendering engines, mathematical software, or simulations involving [Toroidal Geometry]()***.

## Torus [Code]():

<br>

This repository also includes code that demonstrates the generation of a Torus in a programming environment. The code is a practical representation of the parametric equations of the Torus and allows users to visualize and interact with the toroidal shape.

<br>

## Python Code Example to Generate a Torus

<br>

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the parameters for the torus
R = 1  # Major radius
r = 0.4  # Minor radius

# Create a mesh grid for the angles
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)

# Parametric equations for the torus
X = (R + r * np.cos(theta)) * np.cos(phi)
Y = (R + r * np.cos(theta)) * np.sin(phi)
Z = r * np.sin(theta)

# Create the figure and 3D axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the surface with color mapping
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=5, cstride=5, cmap='coolwarm', edgecolor='none')

# Set the limits of the plot
ax.set_xlim([-2, 2])
ax.set_ylim([-2, 2])
ax.set_zlim([-2, 2])

# Set the viewpoint
ax.view_init(elev=20, azim=30)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

<br>

## Code Explanation

<br>

The code provided is a Python script that generates a three-dimensional plot of a torus using the matplotlib library.

<br>

## Step-by-Step explanation of what each part of the code does:

<br>

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
```

  <br>

These lines import the necessary libraries:

- numpy for numerical operations,
  
- matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs,
  
- mpl_toolkits.mplot3d for 3D plotting capabilities.


  <br>

```python
R = 1  # Major radius
r = 0.4  # Minor radius
```

<br>

Here, R and r are defined as the major and minor radii of the torus, respectively.

 <br>
  

```python
# Defining the parametric equations of the Torus
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
phi = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)
```
<br>

These lines create two arrays theta and phi with values ranging from 0 to (2\pi), which represent the angular parameters of the torus. np.meshgrid is then used to create a 2D grid of these angles.

<br>

```python
X = (R + r * np.cos(theta)) * np.cos(phi)
Y = (R + r * np.cos(theta)) * np.sin(phi)
Z = r * np.sin(theta)
```

<br>

The parametric equations for the torus are defined here, calculating the (X), (Y), and (Z) coordinates for each point on the torus surface.

<br>

```python
# Create the figure and 3D axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
```
<br>

A new figure is created, and a 3D subplot is added to this figure.

<br>

```python
# Plot the surface with color mapping
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=5, cstride=5, cmap='coolwarm', edgecolor='none')
```

This line plots the surface of the torus. rstride and cstride control the row and column stride, cmap sets the color map, and edgecolor is set to ‘none’ to not draw borders around the surface patches.

<br>

```python
# Set the limits of the plot
ax.set_xlim([-2, 2])
ax.set_ylim([-2, 2])
ax.set_zlim([-2, 2])
```

<br>

The limits of the (x), (y), and (z) axes are set to range from -2 to 2.

<br>

```python
# Set the viewpoint
ax.view_init(elev=20, azim=30)
```

<br>

The viewpoint of the plot is set with an elevation of 20 degrees and an azimuth of 30 degrees.

<br>

```python
plt.show()
```

Finally, this line displays the following plot.

Each part of the code contributes to creating a visual representation of a torus in 3D space, with specific coloring and viewpoint settings

This script is a practical application of mathematical concepts in computer graphics and can be used for educational purposes or in simulations that require a visual representation of a torus.
